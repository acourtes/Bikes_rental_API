# Bike Rental REST API

This kata has for goal to create a v2 of this API and take into account new features.

At the same time, v1 will have to keep working as usual and live within the same code repo.

The business logic is really poor here and you have to focus on the way to organize your project to have 2 different versions of a given API.
